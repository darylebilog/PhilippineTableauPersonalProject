<p align = "justify">
This project visualizes the Philippine Family Income and Expenditure data using Tableau. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of how household income is distributed across various expenditure categories, including food, education, and other essentials. By examining the data, we can uncover significant insights into the financial behavior of households throughout the country.

Additionally, the dashboard highlights regional disparities in income, housing size, and consumption patterns among the three major island groups: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. These differences shed light on the socioeconomic challenges faced by each region, providing a deeper understanding of how income levels and spending habits vary across the Philippines.
